								Inventure Academy Model United Nations (INMUN) is Inventure’s
								annual national conference meant for high school students. At
								Inventure, a vital part of education is empowering students to
								become changemakers and INMUN has been an avenue for this
								learning. Through regional bodies such as the Lok Sabha, Rajya
								Sabha and the BBMP, we hope to give students an opportunity to
								“be socially responsible”, which is one of Inventure's Core
								Purposes. To create positive change in our society, it is
								important to possess a few key skills, such as critical
								thinking, innovation and collaboration. INMUN imbues these
								skills amongst its participants through experience.

								The UN Convention on the Rights of Child clearly states that the
								youth have the right to participate in all matters that affect
								them. INMUN is the product of having utilised this right to
								voice our opinions. While the desire to participate is
								important, equally important is knowing how to participate
								effectively. INMUN teaches through trial and error the concepts
								behind doing so. Communication, problem solving and policy
								drafting are a few such skills that participants get to put to
								practice, and practice makes perfect. This practice happens
								through debate that often leaves one pondering, fostering
								curiosity to learn more about societal affairs, both past and
								present. As students partake in fun debate, they will also have
								the opportunity to put their interpersonal skills to use,
								networking with participants coming from different parts of
								India.
