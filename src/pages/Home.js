							<p>Dear Delegates,</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								It is my immense pleasure to welcome you to the 11th edition of
								Inventure Academy Model United Nations. From its inception 18
								years ago, Inventure has set its sights on creating
								changemakers. Our flourishing history with change-making through
								dialogue began with the Our Voice platform back in 2014 and has
								continued since. Conferences held in previous years have
								directly impacted society in many ways - from shaping the
								Karnataka Child Shaping and Protection law to helping clean up
								our once beautiful lakes. INMUN continues in its journey to help
								delegates become critical thinkers, leaders and most importantly
								- changemakers.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								The theme of INMUN 2023 revolves around a “Morally Just World”.
								To this end, it is high time that we, as citizens of this world,
								rise above the myopia and disaffection that beset us, and chart
								a new course towards a more equitable, just, and compassionate
								future. A future where the inherent dignity and worth of every
								person are upheld, where justice is not a privilege but a right,
								and where the common good is elevated above narrow
								self-interest.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								The world that was born from a system of balance has descended
								into turmoil. Tragedy exists on every street corner; misery in
								every household; and plentiful corruption in governments
								worldwide. The baleful consequences of this egregious state of
								affairs are manifold and widespread. The dishonest and deceitful
								actions of those in power have resulted in deterioration of the
								public trust, and a corrosive cynicism that destroys the very
								foundations of our democratic institutions. The blatant
								ignorance of the rule of law, the disregard for the common good,
								and the indifference toward the rights and dignity of all people
								have led to a toxic and intractable situation, one that seems to
								ensure further calamity. However, as Martin Luther King Jr once
								said “Out of a Mountain of Despair, A stone of hope”
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								INMUN 2023 explores agendas that will help shape a better
								tomorrow; a tomorrow that hopes to have greater equality,
								justice and peace. Our wide array of agendas ranging from
								operation blue star to the impact of urbanization in the
								Whitefield area, aim to push delegates to their limits in
								invigorating and enthralling debate. To the budding delegates
								planning to join us in August - I hope INMUN acts as a catalyst
								to your journey as a MUNner and helps you grow and appreciate
								the intricacies of the world we live in.
							</p>

							<p>Dear Delegates,</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								It is with pride and pleasure that I serve as your Director
								General for INMUNs 11th edition. My first INMUN, my first MUN
								ever, was in 2018, 5 years ago. I remember myself as a timid
								boy, unable to articulate his thoughts and convey his opinions
								with confidence. It was then where my journey to become who I am
								today began. MUN has taught me how to negotiate, deliberate,
								give rousing speeches, and not least of all listen and
								understand others' perspectives. Creating this “INMUN effect”
								for this year's delegates is my aim as part of the Secretariat.
								As I reflect upon the past 5 years, I understand it is my duty
								and responsibility to carry on the legacy of INMUN. It is a
								hefty challenge, but one I am excited to undertake in my final
								year both as a student and as a part of INMUN.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								MUN is a platform for people to voice their opinion. It is a
								congregation of people holding various ideologies and it is that
								variation that makes MUN exciting. Through taking part in MUNs,
								I have learnt about various social, cultural, economic and
								political issues that have plagued the people, both in the past
								and present. This learning has prepared me for the future,
								helping me form informed opinions based on facts and data. Doing
								MUNs has encouraged me to keep up with current affairs, taking
								note of policy making that affects me. Being aware of my
								situation and voicing my opinion either through protests or
								through voting is the backbone of democracy, especially when it
								comes to being the biggest democracy in the world.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								In the past few years, it has become necessary for people to
								start large movements to achieve justice. Some examples would be
								the “Black Lives Matter” movements and “Fridays for Future” led
								by Greta Thunberg. These examples show the state of our current
								institutions, one in which achieving justice is becoming harder
								and harder. At INMUN 2023, we aim to shed light upon this
								situation and conduct productive debate on what should be done.
								These situations are differing in scale, ranging from Universal
								Health Coverage to discussing the Unplanned Urbanisation of
								Bengaluru.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								As we try to do our little bit in trying to create a positive
								change, we hope you take on the spirit of the conference while
								enjoying its various aspects. I hope you experience growth as a
								person and as a MUNner through this conference.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Looking forward to meeting all of you and hope you have an
								amazing time here at INMUN 2023! ,
